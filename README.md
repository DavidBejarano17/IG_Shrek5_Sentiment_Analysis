To scrape the comments on Instagram I used a  tool called (IG Export & Scraper).

For 100k comments of the Shrek post, I only scrab 10K, due to MetaÂ´s policy which restricts public access to large quantities of data unless you use the official Meta API and obtain the necessary permissions.
**Note:** Web scraping may violate Instagram's Terms of Service, so please use caution if collecting your own data.

Instagram Data: The primary dataset used for this project sentiment analysis is the "shrek_commets_INST.csv"
